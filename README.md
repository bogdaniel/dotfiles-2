# dotfiles
The dotfiles I am currently using in Linux

## Currently using:
- i3wm
- i3blocks (now moved to Polybar but config is still there)
- pywal
- i3lock
- vim
- gnome-terminal (works for me and I see no need to switch - Used terminator before but i3 gives me tiling anyway so it's ok like this)
- powerline (for status line in shell and in vim)
- Polybar

## Plan to use/customize:
- Dunst

## Requirements:
- Pavucontrol (for audio display with i3blocks)
- playerctl (for audio keys control)
- scrot for screenshots in the blur lock screen (Forgot about that)
