# dotfiles
The dotfiles I am currently using in Linux

## Currently using:
- i3wm
- i3blocks
- pywal
- i3lock
- vim
- gnome-terminal (works for me and I see no need to switch - Used terminator before but i3 gives me tiling anyway so it's ok like this)
- powerline (for status line in shell and in vim)

## Plan to use/customize:
- Dunst
- Polybar
